https://mydramalist.com/736293-their-report-card,Hit the Spot,"A warm, friendly, considerate person, Hui Jae is surrounded by people who claim to know and love her. The problem for Hui Jae is that she isn’t really sure if she really understands herself. On the other hand, Mi Na is Hui Jae's confident and energetic best friend and colleague at Play Books, a supplier of books and related products centered around sex and romance. While an expert in how to achieve physical pleasure, her understanding falls short of romantic relationships. When they find themselves told to take over hosting a sex and romance advice podcast, the two feel more than a little lost.

Having never experienced an orgasm or explored her own sexuality beyond routine, lifeless intercourse with her boyfriend of five years, Hui Jae isn’t the most qualified person to be hosting a sex advice podcast. Trapped in a loveless routine of emotionally detached, no-strings-attached casual sex, Mi Na is hardly one to ask for advice on committed romantic relationships. With no one else able to take over the program, though, they really don’t have a choice. 

Suddenly thrust into a world she doesn’t understand, Hui Jae finds herself opening up to new ideas and starts to explore her own body and seek out new experiences. Fed up with cycling through men who only satisfy her body and nothing more, Mi Na, too, desperately wants things to change.

Pooling their lifetime of experiences and newfound knowledge, Mi Na and Hui Jae decide to make a major life change by opening a sex counseling service together. Working to help others find personal satisfaction, will these friends find the satisfaction they both crave?",,Yoon Ra Young,"Romance, Drama, Mature","Extreme Sexual Content, Prolonged Nudity, Sex Education, Life Lesson, Masturbation, Friendship, Social Commentary, Best Friends' Relationship, Female Centered Plot, Podcast, (Vote tags)","Ahn Hee Yeon, Bae Woo Hee, Park Sun Ho, Choi Kwang Rok",8.0,"Dec 23, 2022 - Jan 13, 2023",Friday,COUPANG TV,35 min.,R - Restricted Screening (nudity & violence),"8.2 (scored by 8,539 users)",#1284,#1140,"18,868",Viki

He will defend all kinds of petty offenders. A turning point occurs in his legal career when he becomes the first attorney to win a general criminal retrial case.

Park Sam Soo is a reporter. After he graduated from the university, he worked as a non-permanent employee. Thanks to his excellent writing skills, he became a reporter. He looks for stories which are ignored or passed over by other reporters. He is soft-hearted and easily moved to tears. Though his work does not bring him financial stability, his writings are able to deeply move the hearts of readers, some of whom volunteer their own resources and skills to support his journalism. 

Working with Sam Soo is Lee Yoo Kyung, who, despite a silver-spoon upbringing, is a brave, justice-seeking rookie whose first scoop is Tae Yong's victorious retrial case. Seeing Tae Yong's courtroom performance, Yoo Kyung is, like Sam Soo, struck by his passion, empathy, and drive to bring justice to the victim.

Thirty years ago, when her husband passed away in an accident, Kang Sunok raised her teenage daughters alone. She became famous for her cooking classes with the help of a talented young disciple named Park Eunsil. The oldest daughter, Hyeonjeong, eventually became a well-known news presenter. She has worked hard and never married, but as the story starts, changes are about to come as her boss favours younger women.

At 20 years old, On Joon Yeong is a nerdy, smart university student who wears plain clothes, and plain glasses, and doesn't obsess over fashion.

Fighting back her more vampiric urges, Yeon Seo does her best to blend in at school; a task that, for the most part, has been fairly easy. But when the sweet blood of her classmate, Song Meo Roo, attracts the attention of vampires and werewolves alike, things get a little more complicated. Trying desperately to ignore the siren call of Meo Roo’s blood, Yeon Seo takes it upon herself to protect her classmate from those who hunt him. 

As Yeon Seo and Meo Roo run for their lives, the blood in his veins calls to her. Torn between family duty and the desires of her own heart, a war within Yeon Seo rages. Will she be able to embrace her humanity and resist the temptation of this boy’s sweet blood or will her vampire side rise victorious in the end?

https://mydramalist.com/3777-standby,Standby,"Standby is a workplace comedy that takes place at a fictional broadcast station, where our series lead Ryu Jin finds himself stuck in a career slump (can it be a slump if it never took off?) amidst dreams of anchoring the nightly news. Other characters include variety PDs, writers, and announcers who make up the broadcast station family.

Jung plays a young woman named So-min who grew up in a remote mountain village. She finds herself working a number of odd jobs once she makes the big move to Seoul, determined to make her way in the world and work hard at a successful career. So-min (the character) is a little behind the fashions and tends to say weird things that puzzle people, but she’s got a warm heart and a generous personality. Sadly, though, it’s that trusting nature that also makes her a target for opportunists.

https://mydramalist.com/4073-welcome-rain-to-my-life,Welcome Rain to My Life,"The series revolves around Han Dan Bi, a rude woman who was raised in a wealthy family. Her life becomes difficult after her father, a once-popular singer, meets with an accident that was planned by his wife. Dan Bi then finds out that she was adopted. Her stepmother takes advantage of her husband's comatose state to kick Dan Bi out of their house, all in a plot to sell his land to the ruthless chairman of a hospital company.

This revelation leads Dan Bi to begin searching for her birth mother by using her adoptive father's will as leverage, not knowing that the truth about what happened to her birth father is directly tied to the chairman. She encounters several people along the way: the chairman's grandson who falls for Dan Bi but is uncertain of the outcome if they became a couple; a divorced lawyer whom Dan Bi loves, but whose father is also connected to her birth father, which is the reason why the lawyer's mother disapproves of Dan Bi for her son; the lawyer's ex-wife, and their daughter who likes Dan Bi more than her own mother; a step-sister who sees Dan Bi as a roadblock to climbing the corporate ladder; and an ailing doctor who was not only the love of Dan Bi's adoptive father's life, but knows the real truth about Dan Bi's parentage.
